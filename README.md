Product Management skills are migrating from marketing to product development in technology companies. This migration is driven in part by the shift to Agile development. Increasingly engineers have responsibility for quickly identifying  new product opportunities, executing on them, and ultimately delivering value to customers. Learning product management skills will prepare engineers for these new  responsibilities and build a highly valued career. 

Product Management Project

 To make the Product Management learning experience as valuable and real as possible,  student  teams will pair with class Corporate Partners who wish to explore a new product concept. Students choose and prioritize  which Corporate Partner project they wish to work on. The teaching team will match priorities with available team slots (5 per project).
